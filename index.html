<p>A key reason for the tremendous success of traditional
networks is self management (plug-and-play MAC learning,
routing around failures with default OSPF configuration,
automated load balancing with ECMP, etc.). We
argue that to facilitate large-scale adoption of softwaredefined
networking (SDN), the same level of self management
must be provided. We present SelMa, a selfmanaging
platform for SDNs. SelMa automatically and
proactively generates network configurations that adhere
to operator-specified abstract policies (access control,
traffic steering, etc.) and dynamically adapts configuration
in response to policy/topology changes. To accomplish
this, SelMa leverages new algorithmic insights to
detect policy conflicts, compose policies, and optimize
the translation of abstract global policies to concrete lowlevel
forwarding state configuration. We evaluate a software
implementation of SelMa for large numbers of network
policies and on a broad variety of networks.</p>

<p>If you wish to run Selma on your own network all you have to do is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download "full solution" directory to a windows computer with python 2.7.</li>
<li>Edit the graph file (test.graph) as follows:

<ol>
<li>The first row is the number of nodes (switches or routers) in your graph. The nodes will be identified by a number between 0 and this number minus one.</li>
<li>After a blank row each row represents a directed edge with its weight. For example a directed edge from node "1" to node "2" with weight 4 will be written: "1 2 4".</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Edit the policies input file (policies_input.py) as follows:

<ul>
<li>Give names to ip subnets.</li>
<li>Add each network function to FUNCTIONS_AND_AREAS map, and state where it resides. An integer represents the node in the graph, and a tuple an undirected edge.</li>
<li>Add groups to the GROUPS map, by stating which ip subnets they include.</li>
<li>Put in the IP_LOCATIONS map the location (node) of each subnet.</li>
<li>Add policies as shown in the file to the POLICIES list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
